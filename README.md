# Temperature_Interface
Project to convert a given temperature into Celcius, Fahrenheit, Rankine, and Reaumer.
Temperature Interface implemented in abstract parent class TempImp.
Child classes Celcius and Fahrenheit extend parent class TempImp and consist of two constructors: one that takes in one a temp variable representing either Fahrenheit or Celsius, and one that takes in a temperature variable and a boolean indicating whether or not the temperature is represented in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
